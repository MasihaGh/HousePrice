# HousePrice
This is a mini project in ML-regression (Jadi Course)
Project description :
We have collected information on approximately 4000 apartments in Tehran. All the data is completely real. Your task is to estimate the price in dollars or tomans using the features of the dataset, which are detailed below. The data is stored in the file housePrice.csv.

  Area: Size of the apartment in square meters.  
  Room: Number of bedrooms.
  Parking: Whether the apartment has parking or not.
  Warehouse: Whether the apartment has a warehouse or not.
  Elevator: Whether the apartment has an elevator or not.
  Address: Approximate address in Tehran.
  Price: Price in tomans.
  Price(USD): Price in dollars.
  
In this dataset, some apartments do not have an address, and some have incorrect values for the area (very large numbers). These issues need to be managed by removing those records from the dataset.
